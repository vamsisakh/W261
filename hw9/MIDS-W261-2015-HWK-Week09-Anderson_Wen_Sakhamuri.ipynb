    "PageRank is a query-independent algorithm and metric for measuring the quality of web pages with respect to a web search query.  PageRanks are calculated based on the hyperlink structure of linked webpages. On a high level, PageRanks are determined via the distribution of times spent on each page. The times spent on a page are correlated to the number of links going into and out of a page.  Pages with more links point towards them (and therefore have higher probabilities of being landed on) are ranked higher than those that do not. Therefore, in web search, a web search engine will return results of a user query in the order of page ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the quality of a page, each page can be seen as a state in a Markov Process and a node in a graph, with links as edges between nodes. In the Markov Process, the weights of the edges are the transition probabilities ($P_{ij}$) between one state ($i$) to another ($j$). The steady state probability distributions of landing on any given page are determined by applying the Markov process to the web graph, and power iteration methods to construct a transition matrix $P$ and compute the steady-state left eigenvector:\n",

    "Viewing pages as (memoryless) states of the chain and the webgraph as a transition matrix, which captures the stochastic probabilities for each transition between states (pages). Furthermore, in order for the steady state probabilities to converge, we need to ensure that our probability matrix is primitive and stochastic. Primitive transition matrices imply that we have a well-behaved graph: All nodes can be reached from every other node, and our graph is aperiodic. To ensure aperiodicity to the graph, we can add self-looping edges to cyclic nodes. Additionally, to ensure stochasticity, we need to include the ability to *teleport* from dangling edges--edges that lead to dead-end nodes.  To accomplish this, we include an arbitrary probability (usually around 15%) of teleporting from a dangling edge to any other page/state within the graph."
